This work aims to model the angular velocity channels of the quadcopters via system identification. Based on the identification results, a new control scheme is proposed to improve the performance of a closed-loop system.

Most textbooks present the system model directly to design a control system with a SISO linear system, such as the state space model or transfer function. However, during the actual experiments, the system models are sometimes unavailable. 

This study bridges the actual system and computer-based control system designs. It provides a feasible scheme for acquiring the SISO linear system. According to the coherence function, it unlocks the technique for control system design with computers. __Now, we can touch the real world and feel it.__

## Highlight
1. The frequency response data was obtained by frequency sweeping, and the frequency range that can be
identified as a linear system was analyzed by coherence function. Step angular velocity response tests
were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the identification results.

2. Considering the system’s characteristics, including disturbance, time delay, and resonance, a new
disturbance observer based control scheme was introduced, combining time delay compensation and
notch filter.

3. Undering the torque disturbance with 0.17N · m, the proposed controller demonstrated almost zero error.
Compared with a well-tuned PID controller, 30% overshoot was reduced with the same raising time.

This study performs the system identification procedure during hovering, which significantly reduces the disturbance suffered by the quadcopters. Simultaneously, high-quality sensor signals that benefit from this scheme could be obtained.

Frequency response data is acquired by feeding sinestream to the closed-loop system, the frequency range is arranged within 1Hz-180Hz, and the actual system features by disturbance, time-delay, and resonance. After data preprocessing via a band-pass filter, a system identification toolbox is adopted to acquire the transfer function. Angular velocity step response experiment is performed simultaneously. After comparing numerical simulation and actual response, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the identified transfer function.
