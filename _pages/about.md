Biography
=======
Haixin Zhao is a research assistant at Reliable Flight Control Group at Beihang University.   His research interests lie in the areas of Aerial Robotics and Motion Control.   He received a bachelor's degree in 2020 from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Hebei University of Technology.   He worked as a control engineer on the gimbal for UAV before 2022.   Besides his research, he also follows many other areas, such as signal processing, sensors and actuators, and mechanical and circuit design.

Research Projects

## Motion Control


## Fault Tolerant Control for UAVs
This project focuses on fault-tolerant control algorithms for UAVs with rotor failures, such as Multicopter, Bi-copter, Helicopter, or other kinds of UAVs. Actuator failure is a severe fault, and it can easily result in an aircraft crash. This project aims to challenge the control problems of those UAVs with rotor failure. By abandoning the yaw channel with careful controller design, the fault-tolerant ability of some kinds of UAVs is realized by falling into self-rotation around the yaw for those who suffer from the failures. Some new general problems have arisen by analyzing the principle of those vehicles' fault-tolerant control phenomena. How to design a controller for a rigid body with some actuators in different placements, driven by the controller, the vehicle could be controlled anywhere. However, it does not seem to be a familiar vehicle for people. Moreover, how to design a new vehicle endowed with better controllabilityï¼Ÿ
