This work aims to model the angular velocity channels of the quadcopters via system identification. Based on the identification results, a new control scheme is proposed to improve the performance of a closed-loop system.

Most textbooks present the system model directly to design a control system with a SISO linear system, such as the state space model or transfer function. However, during the actual experiments, the system models are sometimes unavailable. 

This study bridges the actual system and computer-based control system designs. It provides a feasible scheme for acquiring the SISO linear system. According to the coherence function, it unlocks the technique for control system design with computers. Now, we can touch the real world and feel it. [__Read More__](/posts/2022/05/blog-post-1/)




## Fault Tolerant Control for UAVs

This project focuses on fault-tolerant control algorithms for UAVs with rotor failures, such as multicopter, bi-copter, helicopter, or other kinds of UAVs. Actuator failure is a severe fault, and it can easily result in an aircraft crash. 

This study aims to challenge the control problems of those UAVs with rotor failure. By abandoning the yaw channel with careful controller design, the fault-tolerant ability of some kinds of UAVs is achieved by falling into self-rotation around the yaw for those who suffer from the failures. 

Some new general problems have arisen by analyzing the principle of those vehicles’ fault-tolerant control phenomena. How to design a controller for a rigid body with some actuators in different placements, driven by the controller, the vehicle could be controlled by position command. However, it does not seem to be a familiar vehicle for people. Moreover, how to design a new vehicle endowed with better controllability？  [__Read More__](/posts/2023/10/blog-post-2/)
